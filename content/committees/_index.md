# SigHPC Education Working Committees

The SIGHPC Education Chapter relies on volunteers to assist in advancing a variety of training and education topics and activities. We currently have five working committees. Each has a charter purpose and short- and long-term goals. Each of their pages summarizes those goals and links to a description of the current committee projects. If you wish to contribute, you can find volunteer opportunities relating to each of the committees.
