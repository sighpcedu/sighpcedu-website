## Committee Description

This committee is charged with curating, recommending and making available material and resources addressing topics of interest to the HPC systems professionals.  

1. Beyond technical topics of interest this committee is charged with the identification and promotion of materials geared towards initial entry and professional development of the wide range of professionals who help to manage HPC systems.
2. To accomplish this, the committee will work with other committees to leverage existing efforts in technical infrastructure, communications and outreach work and other efforts. 

## Committee Goals

The committee will develop a process through which members can add material to a repository, and prepare materials for workshops and webinars. The Systems Professionals Committee of the SIGHPC Education Chapter has assembled a list of training resources for systems professionals.  In the the future, we also expect to include reviews of the materials.

## Contacts 

We welcome your participation in the education-content committee.  You can join the committee or just volunteer to undertake a part of the on-going projects.
