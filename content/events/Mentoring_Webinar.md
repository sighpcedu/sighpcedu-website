Mentoring has the potential for great impact, and can play a key role in building community and bringing new researchers to HPC. However, sometimes getting involved in mentoring can be intimidating, and it can be difficult to find best practices for mentoring in HPC. In this webinar, "Mentoring: Maximize Your Impact", four panelists with extensive mentoring experience will share their perspectives on effective mentoring, their own experiences, and tips on how to organize your mentoring program, followed by discussion and Q&A. Join us on November 6th at noon EST/5 pm GMT for an exciting discussion!
