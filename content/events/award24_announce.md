The 2024 award goes to Luis Felipe Coimbra Costa for his pioneering work on the Heroine's Learning Journey (HLJ). Luis Felipe developed HLJ to tackle gender disparities in STEM education, particularly in computational science. The programâ€™s innovative approach, which combines narrative-driven learning with the Heroines Learning System (HeLaS), has significantly increased diverse participation in STEM courses. His contributions stand out as a model for inclusivity and motivation in STEM education.

**Honorable Mention: Henry Neeman**

With over 30 years of experience, Henry Neeman has been a pillar in the HPC community. As Director of the University of Oklahoma's Supercomputing Center for Education & Research (OSCER), he has helped countless students and faculty integrate advanced computing into their work. Henry is renowned for his exceptional ability to connect people, fostering collaborations that have shaped computational science education. His leadership in initiatives like the SC11 Education Program has left a lasting impact on K-12 and undergraduate curricula.


Congratulations to Henry Neeman for his Honorable Mention and to Luis Felipe Coimbra Costa for his outstanding achievement!  They will be honored at the award ceremony at SC24 in Atlanta, Georgia in November.  **We commend them for their impactful contributions to computational science education.**
   

The award is co-sponsored by the SIGHPC Education Chapter and SIGHPC.

Basis for the Award
-------------------

The award for outstanding contributions to computational science education is based on these criteria:

*   The work provides innovative training and education materials for computational, data-enabled, and HPC education
*   The impact metrics for the project or program, if available
*   The work has received widespread adoption of their approach and/or materials by other groups/organizations
*   The project or program enhances the ability to engage, serve, and retain a diverse community of participants
*   The work has been recognized through presentations and publications.

The award is granted biennially. The next award competition will be in 2026.
