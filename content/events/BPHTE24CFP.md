## Call for Papers Eleventh SC Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education (BPHTE24)


November 17-22, 2024


Held in conjunction with SC24: The International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis


[https://sc24.supercomputing.org/](https://sc24.supercomputing.org/)



Since 2014, the Best Practices for HPC Training workshop series at SC has provided a global forum for addressing common challenges and solutions for enhancing HPC training and education, for sharing information through large and small group discussions, and for fostering collaboration opportunities. The Eleventh workshop (BPHTE24), an [ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter](https://sighpceducation.acm.org) coordinated effort, is a full day workshop focusing on extending collaborations among practitioners from traditional and emerging fields, exploring the challenges in developing and deploying HPC training and education, and identifying new challenges and opportunities for the latest HPC platforms. The workshop will provide opportunities for: disseminating results, understanding the recent challenges with effectiveness of HPC education and training materials and promoting collaborations among HPC educators, trainers and users. We are planning for papers, lightning talks and demos to be presented by members of the international community. _The workshop papers, extended lightning talks and demo abstracts will be published in a special issue of [Journal of Computational Science Education](http://jocse.org/)_ .

_We are now inviting abstract submissions for papers, lightning talks and demos._

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

*   Scalable and sustainable approaches for HPC training or HPC education
*   Recruiting and retaining diverse individuals and communities
*   Emerging and scalable online environments and tools for HPC education and training
*   Certification of knowledge acquisition from training or education
*   Processes to review training and education content
*   Strategies to address early- and mid-career professionals
*   Delivering effective training and education
*   Identifying training gaps
*   Evaluation, Assessment of training and instructional materials
*   Legal issues involved in training (e.g. ADA compliance, software licenses, intellectual property rights, etc.)
*   Novel andragogical approaches for training and education
*   Innovative pedagogical methods for non-traditional HPC disciplines and non-HPC disciplines
*   Online Tools for HPC Training and Education

## Submission Guidelines  

The Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education (BPHTE24) follows a three-part submission process, with abstracts due by August 12, 2024, notification of acceptance by August 31, 2024, full papers due by September 9, 2024 and presentations by September 16, 2024 (There will be no extensions). Abstracts, papers and presentations must be submitted via the [BPHTE24 online submissions system.](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SC24WorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationAbstract&site=sc24)

_The workshop papers, extended lightning talks and demo abstracts will be published in a special issue of [Journal of Computational Science Education](http://jocse.org/)_ For full consideration for publication, each paper and extended abstract should describe: :  

*   the nature of the training or education program
*   Strategy
*   assessment or evaluation technique
*   situations for which it is relevant or in which it was applied
*   an evaluation of its success
*   lessons learned
*   reproducibility of the processes and resources
*   relevance to the broad range of training or education topics associated with the workshop

## Abstract Submission (due August 12 , 2024)

The first stage of a three-stage submission process for the workshop. The first step is to submit an abstract (max 250 words) for your paper, lightning talk or demonstration submission. Upon submission of this abstract, a link will appear on your "My Submissions" page for you to upload your additional extended abstract (max 2 pages). Incomplete submissions (i.e., ones that do not include a file upload) will not be reviewed. Please view sample submission [here.](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=SampleForm&id=SC20WorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationAbstract&site=sc20)

**Final Paper Submission (due September 9, 2024)**  

Upon acceptance of your abstract, the second stage of the two-stage submission process is to submit a full paper, updated abstract or demo files depending on your submission type, to the online submission system. Please view sample submission [here.](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=SampleForm&id=SC23WorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationFinalSubmission&site=sc24)

**Final Presentation Submission (due September 16, 2024)**  

Upon submission of your final paper, the third stage of the three-stage submission process is to submit a presentation depending on your submission type, to the online submission system. The authors will be provided a basic template to formulate the final presentations.

### Selection Criteria  

The submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical quality, potential impact, insightfulness, depth, clarity, and reproducibility. All the submissions will be required to follow the [reproducibility template](https://sc18.supercomputing.org/app/uploads/2017/12/template_workshops_repro.zip) while preparing their manuscripts. The authors will be required to describe the algorithms and resources used in their paper as completely as possible to allow reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical evaluations, and results. The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment of each submission. Moreover, authors will be strongly encouraged to make their code and data publicly available whenever possible.

### Paper Format  

The submitted paper must follow the Journal of Computational Science Education templates to generate your PDF: [MS Word](http://shodor.org/media/content//jocse/content/JOCSE_Word_Template.zip) and [LaTex](http://shodor.org/media/content//jocse/content/JOCSE_LaTeX_Template.zip). Papers that do not comply with ACM format and maximum 8 page length limit will be returned.

### Review Process 

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 individuals. After the preliminary notification date, authors may rebut reviewer inquiries and their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, the Program Committee will notify authors of the final decision.

### Submission types

All submissions must indicate the topic of interest listed above and the contribution types (full papers, lightning talks and demos). Please view sample submission from Journal of Computational Science Education [here](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=SampleForm&d=SC24WorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationAbstract&site=sc24)

###  Dual submission 

Submission material cannot overlap substantially with any paper previously accepted for publication or under review by any conference or journal during the SC review process.

_Paper submission is available online via: submissions link on the [Workshop website.](https://submissions.supercomputing.org/?page=Submit&id=SC23WorkshopBestPracticesforHPCTrainingandEducationAbstract&site=sc24)_
