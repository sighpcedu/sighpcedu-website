# Seventh Workshop on Strategies for Enhancing HPC Education and Training (SEHET24) Call for Papers





*[PEARC24 Conference](https://pearc.acm.org/pearc24/)*  
*Providence, Rhode Island*  
*July 21-25, 2024*

**Submit your paper via the [EasyChair for SEHET24
website](https://easychair.org/cfp/SEHET24)!**


The SEHET24 workshop is an [ACM SIGHPC Education
Chapter](https://sighpceducation.acm.org) coordinated effort aimed at
fostering collaborations among the practitioners from traditional and
emerging fields to explore strategies to enhance computational,
data-enabled and HPC educational needs. Attendees will discuss
approaches for developing and deploying HPC training and education, as
well as identifying new challenges and opportunities for keeping pace
with the rapid pace of technological advances - from collaborative and
online learning tools to new HPC platforms.

The workshop will provide opportunities for: learning about methods for
conducting effective HPC education and training; promoting
collaborations among HPC educators, trainers and users; and for
disseminating resources, materials, lessons learned and good/best
practices.

This half-day workshop is aimed at users, professionals, researchers,
scholars, educators, and other interested community members with an
active interest in training, educating, using and supporting the HPC
community of developers, researchers, educators, and practitioners. The
workshop will include a panel, presentations and lightning talks. Topics
of interest include but are not limited to:

-   Pedagogical methods/tools enabling Cybersecurity, Accelerated
    Analytics, AI, Cloud applications, Human Powered Computing and other
    emerging technologies
-   Pedagogical methods/tools from TinyML through to Exascale (and
    everything in between)
-   Best practices and models for teaching and learning HPC topics and
    course materials
-   Sustainable educational strategies for HPC education and training
-   Emerging and scalable online environments and tools for HPC
    education and training
-   Evaluation and assessment of training and instructional materials
-   Legal issues involved in training (e.g. ADA compliance, software
    licenses, intellectual property rights, etc.)
-   Novel andragogical approaches for training and education
-   Innovative pedagogical methods for non-traditional HPC disciplines

We invite submissions for full papers and extended abstract lightning
talks. All accepted papers and extended abstracts will be considered for
publication in a special issue of [Journal of Computational Science
Education.](http://jocse.org)

**Important Dates:
Submission Deadline: May 16, 2024
Notification of acceptance: June 3, 2024
Final camera ready submissions: June 17, 2024**

## Paper Submission

*To be accepted for publication, each paper should describe:*

-   the nature of the training or education program
-   Strategy
-   assessment or evaluation technique
-   situations for which it is relevant or in which it was applied
-   an evaluation of its success
-   lessons learned
-   reproducibility of the processes and resources
-   relevance to the broad range of training or education topics
    associated with the workshop

## Paper Format

The submitted paper must follow the Journal of Computational Science
Education templates to generate your PDF: [MS
Word](http://shodor.org/media/content//jocse/content/JOCSE_Word_Template.zip)
and
[Latex](http://shodor.org/media/content//jocse/content/JOCSE_LaTeX_Template.zip).
Papers that do not comply with ACM format and maximum 8 page length
limit will be returned.

## Selection Criteria

The submitted papers will be assessed based on their novelty, technical
quality, potential impact, insightfulness, depth, clarity, and
reproducibility. The authors must describe the algorithms and resources
and processes used in the paper as completely as possible to allow
reproducibility. This includes experimental methodology, empirical
evaluations, and results.

The reproducibility factor will play an important role in the assessment
of each submission. Authors are strongly encouraged to make their code
and data publicly available whenever possible.

## Review Process

Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 individuals. After the
preliminary notification date, authors may rebut reviewer inquiries and
their comments. Based on the rebuttal feedback, the Program Committee
will notify authors of the final decision.

Paper submission is available online via: [EasyChair for SEHET24
website](https://easychair.org/cfp/SEHET24).
