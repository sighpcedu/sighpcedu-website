Do you miss the days when learning about HPC was connecting a few gray boxes together and configuring a cluster? Do you wish you could transfer all the complexity inherent in production HPC systems into an accessible sandbox environment, designed to facilitate teaching and experimental development?</description></item><item><title>Computational Science Education Committee Meeting at 9:00 AM EST on Wed, Jan 1, 2024</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/csecommitteemtg_jan2024/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/csecommitteemtg_jan2024/</guid><description>Computational Science Education Committee will meet on the 4th Wednesday of the month at 9am eastern over the next several months. We will discuss ongoing computational science currciulum projects. The metadata working group will also review metadata work for an HPC education and training catalog from the HPC-ED project, see here for more information.
