The HPC Carpentry project has deep roots in some high-performance computing communities and has evolved considerably over several years. The basic idea is to make use of pedagogical techniques and the community-based continuous self-improvement that can be realized in the open-source world to develop instructional materials for novice users of HPC facilities.
This fills an instructional gap that arises for both novice users of existing facilities, and investigators in research domains where HPC resources are newly available to them, due to the decreasing cost of increasingly sophisticated computing power.</description></item><item><title>Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education at 9:00 AM EST on Sun, Nov 11, 2024</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Feb 2024 08:00:00 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/bphte24cfp/</guid><description>Call for Papers Eleventh SC Workshop on Best Practices for HPC Training and Education (BPHTE24) November 17-22, 2024
Held in conjunction with SC24: The International Conference on High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage, and Analysis

Since 2014, the Best Practices for HPC Training workshop series at SC has provided a global forum for addressing common challenges and solutions for enhancing HPC training and education, for sharing information through large and small group discussions, and for fostering collaboration opportunities.</description></item><item><title>Nominations Open - Educational Award For Outstanding Contribution to Computational Science Education at 9:00 AM EDT on Fri, Jun 6, 2024</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/award24_nominations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/events/award24_nominations/</guid><description>The ACM SIGHPC Education Chapter is announcing the initiation of a biannual education award to recognize outstanding contributions to computational, data-enabled science, and HPC education and training in all disciplines. We are seeking nominations for candidates who have led projects or programs that have made significant contributions to computational science education, defined broadly to include all disciplines and all education levels. The executive committee of the SIGHPC Education Chapter (Chair, Vice-chair, and Secretary-treasurer) and SIGHPC are not eligible for this award.</description></item></channel></rss>
