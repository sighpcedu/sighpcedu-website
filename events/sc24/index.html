The goal is to explore the dynamic interface between QC and HPC education, focusing on evolving user needs, necessary support systems, and innovative strategies to broaden participation in this emerging field. Through interactive discussions, the panel will explore the educational infrastructure and collaborative initiatives essential to cultivating a competent workforce adept at exploiting the capabilities of quantum computing.</p><h2 id=bofs>BoFs</h2><h3 id=hpc-outreach-mastering-the-art-of-science-communication>HPC Outreach: Mastering the Art of Science Communication</h3><p><em>Tuesday, November 19, 12:15-1:15p, B211</em></p><p>Outreach is key to the sustainable growth of fields like HPC, which few people encounter in their daily lives. Effective science communication is essential to convey complex ideas, highlight research, and adapt our messages to resonate with diverse audiences, but many lack training in this crucial area. This session aims to start changing that by sharing experiences and gathering strategies for improvement. We will start with lightning talks before breakout group discussions on engaging with different audiences. Want to master science communication? Start practicing with your community! We invite anyone interested in outreach or science communication to participate.</p><h2 id=supercomputingheroes>Super(computing)heroes</h2><p><em>Wednesday, November 20, 12:15-1:15p, B203</em></p><p>Members of underrepresented groups often lack access to role models within their minority. The HPC community is still predominantly male, making it difficult for young women to find female &ldquo;superheroes&rdquo; to identify with. Such role models are crucial for career planning and guidance. This session aims to provide especially women with the opportunity to meet influential well-recognized female HPC &ldquo;superheroes&rdquo; from academia, research labs, HPC centers and industry. Join us to be inspired and find relatable role models as we work together to build a more inclusive and connected HPC community.</p><h2 id=training-the-next-generation-of-cyberinfrastructure-leaders-and-professionals>Training the Next Generation of Cyberinfrastructure Leaders and Professionals</h2><p><em>Thursday, Nov 21, 12:15-1:15p, B211</em></p><p>This BoF will bring together cyberinfrastructure (CI) professionals and CI professional leaders largely from academia and national labs to discuss how to cultivate the cyberinfrastructure professional workforce.</p><h2 id=challenges-in-professional-skill-development--new-tools-and-strategies>Challenges in Professional Skill Development — New Tools and Strategies</h2><p><em>Tuesday, Nov 19, 5:15-6:45p, B203</em></p><p>Despite the quantity and quality of existing training materials, acquisition and development of HPC skills is still not straightforward enough to address the needs of the growing and diversifying community. The HPC training ecosystem needs to be easier to navigate for both learners and educators. Many elements required to make the ecosystem more FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) already exist; the challenge is to connect them and identify the gaps in content, tools and approaches. This BoF will interactively explore the challenges in designing learning pathways, including the potential use of AI tools for personalized pathway development.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="hidden fixed top-0 left-0 w-screen h-screen z-50 flex place-content-center items-center search-box bg-zinc-800/40 backdrop-blur-sm" onclick=closeSearch(this) id=search-modal><div onclick=event.stopPropagation() class="flex flex-col drop-shadow-md rounded-lg w-5/6 h-5/6 lg:w-3/5 lg:h-3/4 bg-zinc-50 border-zinc-300"><div class="flex p-4 items-center"><div class="border border-zinc-200 rounded-md p-2 flex flex-grow items-center text-zinc-400 focus-within:border-acm-orange focus-within:text-acm-orange"><span class="material-symbols-rounded pr-2">search</span><form autocomplete=off onsubmit=return!1><input class="bg-transparent focus:outline-none" type=text placeholder=search id=search-modal-input onkeyup=search(this,event)></form></div><div class="material-symbols-rounded ml-4 flex-shrink text-2xl cursor-pointer" onclick='closeSearch(document.getElementById("search-modal"))'>close</div></div><div id=search-results class="p-4 overflow-y-auto"></div></div></div><footer class=mt-6><div class="w-full bg-acm-blue h-1"></div><div class="w-full bg-acm-blue-600 h-16 flex items-center justify-center py-6"><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href=/contact target=_blank><i class="fa-solid fa-envelope text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=Email></i></a></div><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href=https://sighpc.slack.com/ target=_blank><i class="fa-brands fa-slack text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=Slack></i></a></div><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href=https://twitter.com/sighpcedu target=_blank><i class="fa-brands fa-twitter text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=Twitter></i></a></div><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href=https://www.linkedin.com/groups/12019017 target=_blank><i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=Linkedin></i></a></div><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href=https://www.facebook.com/sighpcedu/ target=_blank><i class="fa-brands fa-facebook text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=Facebook></i></a></div><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHrmHj6nFfkhlxPv18LpBzw?view_as=subscriber" target=_blank><i class="fa-brands fa-youtube text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=YouTube></i></a></div><div class="px-4 text-2xl"><a href=https://github.com/sighpcedu/ target=_blank><i class="fa-brands fa-github text-white hover:text-acm-orange" title=GitHub></i></a></div></div></footer></div></body></html>
