The committee will explore education programs and instructional materials for computational and data science across the curriculum. This committee is charged with making available educational material relating to computational science and High Performance Computing. To accomplish this, the committee has assembled and maintains a list of related educational resources They also work with the Outreach Committee to identify and promote reviews of education and training content through webinars and chapter blog.</description></item><item><title>K-12 Education Committee</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/committees/k12/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/committees/k12/</guid><description>Committee Description The purpose of the SIGHPC Education K-12 Committee is to support educators introducing HPC &amp;amp; Data Science concepts in K-12 settings by:
Building community and connecting people working in this space Identifying and promoting useful teaching resources and activities, aligned with the discipline standards, including Math &amp;amp; Science (and relevant standards from other countries. Supporting professional development for both in-service and pre-service teachers, particularly in the Computational Thinking and Parallel Thinking spaces Identifying gaps in the existing resources and supporting the development of new resources to fill those gaps.</description></item><item><title>Outreach Committee</title><link>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/committees/outreach/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sighpceducation.acm.org/committees/outreach/</guid><description>Committee Description The outreach committee is responsible for arranging and promoting a variety of communications mechanisms for the Chapter. This includes promotion of workshops via the Chapter website, email, social media, and other communications outlets. The committee also sees volunteers to provide webinars on a variety of HPC education and training topics, posts to the Chapter blog, presentations at professional meetings, and short videos on training topics.
