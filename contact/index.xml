We encourage SIGHPC members to consider serving as a chapter officer. Nominations and applications for officers will be conducted each year and must be submitted around mid-April. The officers shall be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at the annual election, to be held towards the end of April. New officers will take office in May and serve for one year.</description></item></channel></rss>
